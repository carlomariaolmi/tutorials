An AB test is an example of statistical hypothesis testing, a process whereby a hypothesis is made about the relationship between two data sets and those data sets are then compared against each other to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship or not.

To put this in more practical terms, a prediction is made that Page Variation #B will perform better than Page Variation #A, and then data sets from both pages are observed and compared to determine if Page Variation #B is a statistically significant improvement over Page Variation #A.

But that’s not the whole story. The point of AB testing has absolutely nothing to do with how variations #A or #B perform. We don’t care about that.

What we care about is how our page will ultimately perform with our entire audience.

And from this birdseye view, the answer to our original question is that statistical analysis is our best tool for predicting outcomes we don’t know using information we do know.

In short, statistical analysis allows us to use information we know to predict outcomes we don’t know with a reasonable level of accuracy.
